    cmsgbuf still getting set wrong.  (basically I messed up my order of
    operations and sent pointers flying off into who knows where.  Ooops.)

  * Acknowledge NMU
  * Apply patch from Loïc Minier <lool@dooz.org> to fix arping behavior
    when -w and -c command line flags are given and the target host
    does not reply.  (Closes: Bug#233125)

  * NMU
  * Use IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT instead of IPV6_HOPLIMIT in ping6 to build
    with current kernel headers. Closes: #391601
  * Explicitly build-depend on the current version of linux-kernel-headers
    since older ones don't have IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT.

iputils (3:20020927-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * only requst AF_INET address in ping and tracepath, since these
    tools only deal with IPv4 addresses.  (Closes: Bug#305062)
  * SO_TIMESTAMP is no longer broken on SPARC so its use is no longer
    disabled.  (Closes: Bug#330909)
  * Report all valid ICMP response types in ping (Closes: Bug#186745)
  * Don't print out a bogus and broken statistics line upon exit
    if using -A and pinging an unresponsive host.  (Closes: Bug#180903)
  * Provide a somewhat more descriptive warning if CONFIG_FILTER is
    not supported in the kernel.  This shouldn't matter anymore, since
    it's always enabled on modern kernels.  (Closes: Bug#139151)
  * Use debhelper compat level 4.
  * Move binaries to /usr/bin (Closes: Bug#141799)

iputils (3:20020927-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build system cleanup.  Stop including anything from /usr/src/linux.
    We still define our own versions of things that should be included
    from /usr/src/sys, and this needs to be fixed, but I will wait until
    post sarge to do so.  (Closes: Bug#223164)
  * Install symlink for tracepath6 man page.

iputils (3:20020927-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  (Closes: Bug#151980)
  * Changed iputils-ping to Priority: important
  * Changed iputils-tracepath to Priority: optional
  * Added RELNOTES to /usr/share/doc/iputils-* as the upstream changelog.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.5.7.0
  * Changed the sparc kludge (see prev. version's changes) to avoid
    using the SO_TIMESTAMP sockopt, since that seems to be where the 
    problem is.  -U is no longer forced.
  * Fixed '==' typo on line 444 of traceroute6.c.  The patch has been
    sent upstream and will be in future releases.

iputils (3:20020124-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added kludge to force -U on ping and ping6 on SPARC, since neither
    program will report correct times at all otherwise.  This will be fixed
    correctly at some point in the future, but possibly not before
    woody's release.  (Closes: Bug#122379)
  * Fixed a printf error in tracepath6.c that caused some slightly
    ugly (non zero-padded) output. (Closes: Bug#141300)
  * Fixed a typo in tracepath.8 (Closes: Bug#135274)
  * Removed reference to clockdiff(8) from arping.8 since clockdiff
    is not packaged.

    functions. 

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Mon, 29 Jan 2001 23:39:31 +1000

iputils (20001110-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Closes: Bug#80250, Bug#80251)
  * Removed most of the Debian patches: too much has changed upstream to
    reasonably forward port them. Maxwait argument thus
    disappeared. (Closes: Bug#65597)
  * Shouldn't have any security problems, theoretically. (Closes: Bug#69472)
  * Descriptions have been updated a while ago. (Closes: Bug#68973)

  * Orphaned, maintainer set to debian-qa.

    tracepath, tracepath6 and traceroute6 binaries to /usr/sbin.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Aug 2000 20:25:21 +1000

iputils (990107-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop priority to extra (it conflicts: with a standard package so
    shouldn't be optional anway), and add a note to the description. 

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Aug 2000 23:49:58 +1000

iputils (990107-1) unstable; urgency=low
